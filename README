Tk-CanvasLogo version 0.01
==========================

Tk::CanvasLogo - a Tk::Canvas widget that can support methods based on the
Logo Programming Language as well as multiple turtles.

	use Tk;
	use CanvasLogo;

	my $top = MainWindow->new();
	my $logo = $top->CanvasLogo->pack();
	my $turtle = $logo -> NewTurtle;
	$turtle -> LOGO_FD(50); # forward 50 
	MainLoop();

The Tk::CanvasLogo widget is a regular Canvas widget that adds
support to allow drawing on the canvas with Logo commands.
The user first creates a CanvasLogo widget. Then using that
widget, the user creates turtle objects which are attached 
to that CanvasLogo widget. Turtle objects can then execute
Logo-based methods.
