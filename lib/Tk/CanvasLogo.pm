=head1 NAME

Tk::CanvasLogo - a Tk::Canvas widget that can support methods based on the
Logo Programming Language as well as multiple turtles.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Tk;
	use CanvasLogo;

	my $top = MainWindow->new();
	my $logo = $top->CanvasLogo->pack();
	my $turtle = $logo -> NewTurtle;
	$turtle -> LOGO_FD(50); # forward 50 
	MainLoop();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Tk::CanvasLogo widget is a regular Canvas widget that adds
support to allow drawing on the canvas with Logo commands.
The user first creates a CanvasLogo widget. Then using that
widget, the user creates turtle objects which are attached 
to that CanvasLogo widget. Turtle objects can then execute
Logo-based methods. 

The following methods are currently supported.

$turtle->LOGO_FD(N); # move turtle forward N pixels

$turtle->LOGO_BK(N); # move turtle backward N pixels

$turtle->LOGO_RT(N); # turn turtle Right (clockwise) N degrees

$turtle->LOGO_LT(N); # turn turtle Left (counter clockwise) N degrees

$turtle->LOGO_PU; # turtle's "pen" up. moving turtle while pen up will not draw.

$turtle->LOGO_PD; # turtle's "pen" down. moving turtle while pen down will draw.

$turtle->LOGO_CS; # Clear screen. This will clear the turtle and everything it drew. It will not clear entire canvas. Use Canvas->delete('all') for that.

$turtle->LOGO_HOME; # move turtle to center of screen facing straight up.
